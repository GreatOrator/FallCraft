    # Where: - The item name will be what the item is registered as (there will be
    # a 'lootplusplus:' added to the front of it automatically; don't add
    # anything with a colon yourself!). - The item display name is what people will see in-game.
    # - The texture location is the name of the png file you place in the resource 
    # pack, in the 'assets/minecraft/items' folder without the .png.
    # - If shines is true, the food item will shine like enchanted items.
    # - The food restored is the amount of food restored in half bars.
    # - The saturation is how much saturation is given by the food (time until you
    # get hungry again).- If wolves eat is true, wolves can eat the food.
    # - If always edible is true, you can eat the food even if you're not hungry.
    # - Time to eat is how long it takes to eat the item (32 normally).
    # - Finally the potions the food gives you is a list of potion effects in the format:
    # 
    #       ..._____<Potion effect id>-<Potion duration>-<Potion level (0 is 1)>-<Probability (between 0.0 and 1.0)>_____...
